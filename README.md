## Compilation
This project was created and compiled using Unreal Engine 4.22.0. To reduce the upload size, the folders containing the compiled files have been eliminated from this code.
This code has been tested most recently on Unreal Engine 4.25.4 and ran with no issues.
To compile the code, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites
* A functional installation of Unreal Engine, preferably 4.22.0 or later.

### Steps
* Download and extract the source code to any folder. Navigate to it.
* Open the CPlusPlusCharacter.uproject file in Unreal Engine. A dialog stating the project was built in a different engine version should open.
* Select 'Build'. This process will take a few minutes to complete.
* If any error messages were received, close the error message and navigate to Saved\Logs. Check the latest .log file and search for any errors, before a message saying "UnrealBuildTool will quit". The method of fixing errors will vary depending on the type of errors received. Checking Unreal Engine's site regarding them will be helpful. You will need to modify the erroneous source file and change the code wherever required. Fix the errors and repeat the previous procedure.
* If there are no issues with the code, Unreal Engine should open immediately once compilation is completed.
* The project will now be working within Unreal Editor 4.
